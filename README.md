# redHealth

This package contains functions written to facilitate Chris's project *Detrimental Influences*, which explores the association between redlining, segregation, and health. You can read more about the project itself on [Chris's website](https://chris-prener.github.io/project/redlining/).

## Installation

Since this is project software, `redHealth` is not destined for CRAN. If you want to use some of its functionality in your own work, you can install it using the `remotes` package:

``` r
remotes::install_github("prenerLab/redHealth")
```
